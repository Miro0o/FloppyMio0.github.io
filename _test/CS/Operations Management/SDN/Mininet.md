## Intro

Mininet creates a **realistic virtual network**, running **real kernel, switch and application code**, on a single machine (VM, cloud or native), in seconds, with a single command:

Because you can easily [interact with](http://mininet.org/sample-workflow/#interacting-with-a-network) your network using the Mininet [CLI](http://mininet.org/walkthrough/#interact-with-hosts-and-switches) (and [API](http://mininet.org/api/annotated.html)), [customize](http://mininet.org/sample-workflow/#customizing-a-network) it, [share](http://mininet.org/sample-workflow/#sharing-a-network) it with others, or[deploy](http://mininet.org/sample-workflow#running-on-hardware) it on real hardware, Mininet is useful for [development](http://mininet.org/sample-workflow), [teaching](http://mininet.org/teaching), and [research](http://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/).

Mininet is also a great way to develop, share, and experiment with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) systems using[OpenFlow](https://opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/) and [P4](http://p4.org/).

Mininet is actively developed and supported, and is released under a permissive BSD Open Source [license](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/blob/master/LICENSE). We encourage you to [contribute](http://mininet.org/contribute) code, bug reports/fixes, documentation, and anything else that can improve the system!
